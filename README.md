# go-interpreter

An interpreter written in Go as described in [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). The book is great and I highly recommend it.

The plan is to follow the book to completion then make some feature additions before writing my own interpreter from scratch.

## Planned Feature Additions
* Float literals
* Character literals
* Ternary statements
* Less Than or Equal and Greater Than or Equal operators
* AND and OR operators
* Else-If statements
* Switch statements
* While loops
* For loops
* Do-While loops
* Dynamic list structure
* Emojis
